Sample programs from the Elements of AI Book:

Baroque.java is based off the Baroque chess project suggested by Tanimoto in Chapter 5.
I chose to use Java because of the ease of readability and vast number of built in data structures
and algorithsm.  
Later on, I will attempt to code the examples from that book using SBCL and/or Emacs Lisp.

8/28/2022 -- The chessboard and chess pieces have been drawn out in Java Swing.  The location of the
chess pieces on the board are stored in a hash map.

1/9/2023 -- I plan to put the Baroque Chess game into its own repository later on.  Right now, I will
use this directory for typing out the examples in Java and use the Java JgraphT library instead of 
writing out the graph search algorithms manually.
