The goal of the program is to use the BFS search algorithm to plan the robotic arm movement when there are multiple blocks to be moved.

2/4/2023 -- In the robot search program, work on debugging the recursive clearTop function. The program places block B on top of A but the values in the waste column get clobbered when clearing the excess blocks off the top of A. 2/5/2003 -- Robot search program is closed to being done. I created an extra variable to hold the inputNode char value and that solved the problem of the waste column being clobbered. The next step is to continue reading the blue book and get started on writing a Tic Tac Toe game in Java.

2/10/2023 -- The optimal solution for the robot search program is to use an A* manhattan search algorithm with the flight path positions used as the nodes.  At somepoint, I might implement the problem using the letters (LRUDCO)* as the graph and test out each combination of strings to get the result of the nodes to see if putOn(A,B) is a success or not.  Searching through string combinations is not as efficient as searching through the flight path space and getting the string result from that.
